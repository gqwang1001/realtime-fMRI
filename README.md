# realtime-fMRI

This project aims to read and process the fMRI data in real time. 

At this moment, the project has been optimized for best performance on MAC. We will further develop for optimization on Windows.

`main.m` file is the main file to process the data. Please modify the working and data directory accordingly.

Also, when finished the selection of seed, please press any key to continue the analysis.

Please notice that the code was developed on the `Matlab R2020a` release. Running on the earlier releases might report errors.
